FiZk Advanced Seed Generator
===========================

This utility lets you create a secure 64-character hex seed from ANY input words.
Unlike standard BIP39, you can use any words, phrases, or text you want!

FEATURES:

* Use any number of words - not just 12/24
* Words don't need to be from a specific wordlist
* Three different generation methods for different security profiles
* Works with completely random words
* Creates a seed compatible with FiZk's direct seed entry
* Detailed mode to see the processing steps

USAGE EXAMPLES:

1. Basic usage with your own words:
   python seedgen.py --words "any words you want to use no specific format required"

2. Using the Personal Mixer method (good for memorability):
   python seedgen.py --words "my base phrase" --method 2 --personal "name:John,date:1990-05-15"

3. Using the Word Pattern method:
   python seedgen.py --words "mix these words together in a pattern" --method 3

4. Generate using completely random words:
   python seedgen.py --random 20 --method 1

5. Save the output to a file:
   python seedgen.py --words "my phrase" --output myseed.txt

6. Show detailed processing information:
   python seedgen.py --words "my phrase" --method 1 --detail
   (or use -d shorthand: --random 10 -d)

METHODS EXPLAINED:

1. Entropy Mixing (Default): Best for maximum randomness
   Applies multiple hash algorithms in 1000 rounds of mixing

2. Personal Mixer: Best for memorable seeds
   Combines personal information with your words for unique results

3. Word Pattern Mixing: Best for custom word patterns
   Analyzes the pattern and relationships between your words

SECURITY TIPS:

* Use a mix of common and uncommon words for stronger seeds
* Add personal details that only you would know
* For highest security, generate seeds on an offline computer
* Never share your seed with anyone
